# SVG Transition Plugin
SVGs can sometimes turn into nightmares, especially when it comes to SVG animations. When you have a static animation, they are great, but what if you need an SVG transition? The type of transition that you can dynamically activate or deactivate, similar to how it is done in CSS transitions. The type of transition that can be controlled by adding or removing classes. And finally, the type of transition that you can set its progress programmatically. That is exactly where this plugin comes in. Just look at the following images:

</p>
